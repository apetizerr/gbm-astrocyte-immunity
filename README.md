# Figure Reproduction: *Glioblastoma-instructed astrocytes suppress tumour-specific T cell immunity* [Faust et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08997-x#Abs1)

## Overview

This project aims to reproduce key figures from the paper:

> Faust, T., et al. (2020). *Glioblastoma-instructed astrocytes suppress tumour-specific T cell immunity*. **Nature**. [DOI:10.1038/s41586-020-2780-y](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2780-y)

The study explores how astrocytes in the glioblastoma microenvironment become reprogrammed by tumor cells to suppress cytotoxic T cell responses, thereby contributing to immune evasion and tumor persistence. This project serves as both a technical exercise in figure reproduction and a conceptual deep dive into tumor–glia–immune interactions.

## Objectives

- Reproduce selected figures from the Faust et al. study using open-access data
- Explore and visualize GBM-induced astrocytic immune suppression
- Apply single-cell RNA-seq analysis tools in R (e.g., Seurat)
- Evaluate reproducibility and scientific communication in cancer immunology
